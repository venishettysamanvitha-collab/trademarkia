# Semantic Search System

A lightweight semantic search engine with fuzzy clustering and cluster-accelerated semantic caching, built on the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

## Architecture


Query → Embedding → Cache Lookup → (Hit?) → Return Cached Result

&nbsp;                                  (Miss?) → FAISS Search → Cluster Assignment → Cache Store → Return Result

## Components

| Module | Purpose |

|---|---|

| embeddings.py | Loads 20 Newsgroups, generates embeddings using all-MiniLM-L6-v2, persists to disk |

| search.py | FAISS-based exact nearest-neighbor search (IndexFlatL2) |

| clustering.py | Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for fuzzy/soft clustering with BIC-based model selection |

| cache.py | Cluster-accelerated semantic cache with cosine similarity matching |

| main.py | FastAPI service wiring all components together |

## Design Decisions

### 1. Embedding Model — all-MiniLM-L6-v2

- Produces 384-dimensional embeddings — compact enough for fast search, rich enough for strong semantic quality.

- Trained on 1B+ sentence pairs, making it robust across the diverse topics in 20 Newsgroups (politics, sports, hardware, religion, etc.).

- Larger models (e.g., all-mpnet-base-v2, 768-dim) offer marginal quality gains but double the embedding size and inference time — unnecessary for this scale.

### 2. Fuzzy Clustering — GMM over KMeans

- **KMeans** produces hard assignments — each document belongs to exactly 1 cluster. This doesn't reflect reality where a document about "sports cars" could belong to both automotive and sports topics.

- **GMM** natively outputs posterior probabilities P(cluster\_k | document) via Bayesian inference, providing true fuzzy membership distributions.

- GMM also models clusters as ellipsoids with varying covariances, capturing the reality that topic clusters have different shapes and spreads.

### 3. Cluster Count Selection — BIC

- Instead of hardcoding an arbitrary number of clusters, we use the **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** to find the optimal k.

- BIC balances model fit against complexity: BIC = -2 \* log\_likelihood + n\_params \* log(n\_samples)

- Evaluated k=8 to k=21; **k=8** achieved the lowest BIC score (-24,267,231), indicating 8 clusters best explain the data without overfitting.

### 4. Semantic Cache — Cluster-Accelerated Lookup

- A naive cache scans every entry on every lookup — O(n).

- By bucketing cache entries by their dominant cluster (from the GMM), we only compare queries against entries in the **same cluster** — reducing lookup to O(n/k).

- **Cosine similarity threshold (0.85):** Queries must be near-paraphrases to trigger a cache hit. Lower threshold = more hits but less precision. Higher = fewer hits but guaranteed relevance.

### 5. Vector Search — FAISS IndexFlatL2

- Exact brute-force L2 search. For ~18,000 documents with 384-dim embeddings, search is sub-millisecond.

- If the corpus grew to millions, we'd switch to approximate methods (IVF, HNSW) for sub-linear search time.

## API Endpoints

### POST /query

Search for semantically similar documents.

// Request

{ "query": "What is the best graphics card for gaming?" }



// Response

{

&nbsp; "query": "What is the best graphics card for gaming?",

&nbsp; "cache\_hit": false,

&nbsp; "result": \[

&nbsp;   { "rank": 1, "document": "...", "l2\_distance": 0.82 },

&nbsp;   { "rank": 2, "document": "...", "l2\_distance": 0.87 }

&nbsp; ],

&nbsp; "dominant\_cluster": 3,

&nbsp; "cluster\_distribution": \[0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.85, ...]

}
### GET /cache/stats

View cache performance metrics.

{

&nbsp; "total\_entries": 12,

&nbsp; "hit\_count": 5,

&nbsp; "miss\_count": 7,

&nbsp; "hit\_rate": 0.417

}
### DELETE /cache

Flush all cached entries and reset statistics.

## Cluster Analysis Results

| Cluster | Size | Themes |

|---------|------|--------|

| 0 | 1,975 | Mixed topics |

| 1 | 2,414 | Mixed topics |

| 2 | 879 | Smallest — niche topics |

| 3 | 1,727 | Mixed topics |

| 4 | 2,150 | Mixed topics |

| 5 | 3,520 | Largest — broad general topics |

| 6 | 2,826 | Mixed topics |

| 7 | 2,638 | Mixed topics |

**Boundary cases** (documents with high entropy — genuinely uncertain membership):

- Documents with membership split across multiple clusters confirm that fuzzy clustering captures real-world topic overlap.

## Setup & Installation

### Local

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
First run takes ~15 minutes (embedding generation + BIC evaluation). Subsequent runs load from disk in seconds.

### Docker

docker-compose up --build
### Environment Variables (optional)

HF\_HUB\_OFFLINE=1          # Skip HuggingFace update checks

TRANSFORMERS\_OFFLINE=1     # Use locally cached model
## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** — async web framework

- **Sentence-Transformers** — all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings

- **FAISS** — Facebook AI Similarity Search for vector retrieval

- **scikit-learn** — Gaussian Mixture Model for fuzzy clustering

- **NumPy** — numerical operations

## Dataset

**20 Newsgroups** — 18,129 documents (after cleaning) across 20 categories covering politics, religion, sports, technology, science, and more.

Cleaning: Removed headers, footers, and quotes (email metadata). Filtered documents shorter than 30 characters (artifacts of metadata removal).
