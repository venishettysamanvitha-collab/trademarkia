"""
Semantic Cache Module (Part 3)

Design Decisions:
-----------------
1. Why cluster-accelerated lookup:
   - A naive cache scans every entry on every lookup — O(n) per query.
   - By organizing cache entries into cluster buckets (using the fuzzy clustering
     from Part 2), we only compare the query against entries in the SAME cluster.
   - This reduces lookup time proportionally to the number of clusters. With 15
     clusters and uniform distribution, we scan ~1/15th of the cache.
   - As the cache grows large, this becomes critical for keeping response times low.

2. Similarity threshold (tunable parameter):
   - The threshold controls the trade-off between cache hit rate and result accuracy.
   - LOW threshold (e.g., 0.75): More cache hits, but may return results for queries
     that are only loosely related. Good for FAQ-style systems where approximate
     answers are acceptable.
   - HIGH threshold (e.g., 0.95): Fewer cache hits, but near-guarantee that cached
     results are relevant. Appropriate when precision matters more than speed.
   - DEFAULT (0.85): A balanced choice — empirically, cosine similarity > 0.85
     between MiniLM embeddings indicates paraphrases or near-identical intent.
   - The threshold is exposed as a constructor parameter so it can be tuned and
     its effect on hit_rate observed via the /cache/stats endpoint.

3. No external libraries:
   - The cache is a pure Python dict-of-lists structure. No Redis, Memcached, or
     any caching middleware. Every line of cache logic is hand-written.

4. Storing original query text:
   - Each cache entry stores the original query string so we can return
     "matched_query" on a hit, showing the user which previous query was similar.
