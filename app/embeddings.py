Embedding & Vector Database Setup (Part 1)

Design Decisions:
-----------------
1. Model Choice: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   - This model produces 384-dimensional embeddings, which is compact enough for
     fast similarity search while retaining strong semantic quality.
   - It is trained on over 1 billion sentence pairs, making it robust for
     general-purpose semantic similarity — ideal for the diverse topics in the
     20 Newsgroups dataset (politics, sports, hardware, religion, etc.).
   - Larger models (e.g., all-mpnet-base-v2) offer marginal quality gains but
     double the embedding dimension (768) and inference time, which is unnecessary
     for a lightweight search system.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - We remove headers, footers, and quotes via fetch_20newsgroups built-in flags.
     These contain metadata (email addresses, "Re:" chains, signatures) that add
     noise and would cause the model to cluster by author/thread rather than topic.
   - We additionally filter out:
     a) Empty or whitespace-only documents (no semantic content).
     b) Documents shorter than 30 characters — these are typically residual
        artifacts after header/footer removal (e.g., single words, "yes", "me too").
   - We do NOT apply aggressive lowercasing or stopword removal because the
     sentence-transformer model handles raw text natively and benefits from
     natural casing and word context.

3. Persistence:
   - FAISS index and metadata are saved to disk so embeddings are not regenerated
     on every server restart. This is critical for a production-ready service.
