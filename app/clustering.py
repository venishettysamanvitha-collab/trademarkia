Fuzzy Clustering Module (Part 2)

Design Decisions:
-----------------
1. Why Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) instead of KMeans:
   - The assignment explicitly requires FUZZY (soft) clustering where each document
     belongs to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.
   - KMeans produces hard assignments. While you can hack soft probabilities from
     distances, this is geometrically unprincipled — it assumes spherical clusters
     of equal size and doesn't model overlap.
   - GMM natively outputs posterior probabilities P(cluster_k | document) via
     Bayesian inference. These are true membership distributions, not heuristics.
   - GMM also models clusters as ellipsoids with different covariances, capturing
     the reality that topic clusters in text data have varying shapes and spreads.

2. Choosing the number of clusters (n_clusters):
   - The dataset has 20 labeled categories, but many overlap semantically
     (e.g., comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and comp.sys.mac.hardware share vocabulary).
   - We use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to find the optimal number of
     clusters. BIC balances model fit against complexity, penalizing overfitting.
   - The optimal n is determined empirically at startup via evaluate_cluster_count()
     and logged with evidence. This replaces an arbitrary hardcoded value.
   - If BIC evaluation is skipped (e.g., for speed), we default to 15 clusters as a
     reasonable middle ground between the 20 labels and the ~10-12 truly distinct
     semantic groups typically found in this dataset.

3. Cluster analysis:
   - The analyze_clusters() method provides tools to inspect:
     a) What lives in each cluster (top documents closest to the centroid)
     b) Boundary cases (documents with high entropy across clusters)
     c) Cluster size distribution
   - This satisfies the requirement to "convince a sceptical reader that the
     clusters are semantically meaningful."
